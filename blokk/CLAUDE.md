# CLAUDE.md

Context for Claude Code working in this repo. Read this before changing
anything.

## What Blokk is

A local agent runtime for several small businesses on one Mac. It sweeps mail,
calendar and other sources overnight, queues anything needing a decision, and
learns from the corrections. Nothing leaves the machine.

Stdlib only — no `pip install` for Blokk itself. That constraint is
deliberate: this has to still boot in two years on a machine nobody has
maintained. **Do not add a dependency without asking.** The one exception is
the model server, which is a separate process behind an HTTP interface.

## The invariants

These are load-bearing. Breaking one is not a refactor, it is a different
product.

**1. The workflow decides. Activities do.**
Workflow code in `flows/` is deterministic — no clock, no network, no
randomness, no `uuid4`. Every side effect goes through
`ctx.activity(..., side_effect=True)`, which carries an idempotency key
derived from run and step. On restart the journal replays: completed steps
return recorded results without executing. Use `ctx.now()` and `ctx.uuid()`,
never the real ones.

**2. One write path.**
Everything that changes the world funnels through the approval queue and the
trust gate in `core/harness.py:Policy`. The chat surface (`core/ask.py`) is
read-only *by construction* — there is no write tool in that file, and adding
one would reopen the injection trifecta through the front door. If Ask needs
to act, it queues a proposal.

**3. Untrusted content is data, never instruction.**
Anything fetched from outside — an email body, a web page — carries
`provenance` and goes through `quarantine_read` before reaching a model. The
regex in there is triage, not defence; the defence is that the reader has no
tools. Do not "improve" it into a filter people rely on.

**4. Trust is per workspace AND per category, and never transfers.**
Ninety clean approvals on cottage enquiries earns cottage enquiries autonomy.
It earns invoice chasing nothing. Some categories are pinned to manual and
must never graduate. Trust goes down as well as up: a rejection revokes
autonomy and the threshold has to be met again from zero, or the ledger only
ever ratchets and a category that has gone wrong keeps acting alone.

**5. Scope is data, not prompt.**
Workspace isolation is enforced in SQL and in the credential registry. An
agent told not to look at another workspace will eventually look at another
workspace.

**6. Fail loudly, degrade locally.**
One broken connector must not take the night's sweep. One malformed row must
not take an endpoint. But nothing may fail *silently* — a truncated stream, a
dropped connection or a greyed-out card that did not actually send are all
worse than an error.

## Layout

    blokk              single entrypoint: wizard if unconfigured, else run
                       ./blokk update  ./blokk doctor
    setup.sh / run.sh  terminal equivalents; share core/plan.py + core/servers.py
    bench.py           sizes the machine; --serve measures; --compare settles
    connect.py         data sources, workspaces, backups — CLI over core/sources.py
    regress.py         run the frozen examples against whatever is attached
    seed.py            sample world, safe to re-run

    core/schema.sql    the data model. One SQLite file; the thing to back up
    core/durable.py    journal, replay, idempotency, signal suspend/resume
    core/harness.py    agent loop, context budget, policy gate, consolidation
    core/ask.py        read-only chat agent, AG-UI events
    core/models.py     Router + ServedModel (any OpenAI-compatible server)
    core/backends.py   llama.cpp vs MLX rule, with the evidence in comments
    core/nightly.py    the night shift: when to sweep, and what window to read
    core/plan.py       shape -> per-tier plan
    core/servers.py    model server lifecycle + blokk.conf i/o, shared by GUI
                       and CLI. Writes logs/<tier>.log
    core/gguf.py       bounded GGUF header reader; KV cache arithmetic
    core/weights.py    the models/ folder: symlink a .gguf in, take it out
    core/sources.py    add/remove/peek a data source; shared by CLI and GUI
    core/local.py      what this Mac will hand over without a password
    core/backup.py     online snapshot of blokk.db, and verifying one
    core/regression.py twenty frozen examples and the assertions on them
    core/doctor.py     why the phone cannot reach this Mac, and why the
                       agent cannot reach a model
    core/qr.py         QR for the phone URL, no dependency
    core/connectors/   iCloud IMAP + CalDAV, local Mail + Calendar, Messages,
                       keychain, and the fake world
    flows/             workflow definitions
    api/server.py      control plane. Stdlib http.server. Holds credentials
    web/               dashboard, setup wizard, sources, phone, update and
                       appearance panels, PWA. Parity with connect.py is
                       deliberate: both call core/sources.py, neither
                       reimplements it. The look is iOS 27 Liquid Glass —
                       chrome is glass, content is not, and Reduce
                       Transparency wins over the in-app slider
    demo/              browser port of the engine + the test suites
    brand/             the mark, generated parametrically

## Tests — run all four before committing

    python3 demo/hunt.py       adversarial pass over the server
    node demo/hunt_ui.js       adversarial pass over the front end
    node demo/contract.js      API satisfies what paint() reads
    node demo/journey.js       four end-to-end journeys

Or `./test.sh`. All four must print `0 issues found` / `pass`.

Two entries in `hunt.py` report `ok` because they are **choices, not defects**:
loopback is trusted without a token (A1), and episodes outlive the approvals
they came from (A7). Do not "fix" them.

`demo/engine.js` is a port of `core/durable.py` and `core/harness.py`. **If
you change a threshold or a rule in Python, change it there too and re-run
`journey.js`**, or the two drift and the demo starts lying.

## Conventions

* Comments explain *why*, and especially why-not. If a line looks wrong and
  isn't, say what it is defending against.
* A bug fix gets a probe in `hunt.py` or `hunt_ui.js`. Fixed once is not
  fixed.
* Search, don't list. Every read takes a filter and a limit.
* Error messages name what broke and what to do. "Connection refused" in a log
  at 04:00 is not an error message.
* Shell scripts must run on **bash 3.2** — macOS still ships it. No `${var,,}`,
  no `${arr[-1]}`, no associative arrays.
* The GUI and the CLI must not be two implementations. A new capability goes
  in `core/`, and `connect.py` and `api/server.py` both call it. The one thing
  the GUI deliberately cannot do is take a password.
* Never put prompt or completion text in span attributes or logs. Hash and
  pointer only; guest names must not end up in a second store with different
  retention.

## Known-good state

All four suites green. Verified behaviours:

* crash after a side effect, restart -> 4 steps replayed, 227k tokens not
  re-spent, 1 send fired, 0 duplicates
* injected email quarantined and given no draft
* approving 20 clean graduates a category; pinned categories never do
* rejecting takes the autonomy back, not just the counter — it has to be
  earned again from zero. An edit does not: a correction is not a veto
* a dead model server degrades per workspace rather than 500ing the sweep
* a silent model server is detected in 0.4s (output drained on a thread)
* a model server that dies leaves its reason in logs/<tier>.log, and
  `./blokk doctor` prints it along with which of the four faults it is
* the sweep runs itself. A laptop asleep at 04:00 sweeps once when the lid
  next opens, not twice and not never, and reads everything since the last
  sweep rather than a fixed twelve hours
* a source Blokk cannot read says so, rather than returning an empty list
* calendars nested in a .caldav container are found (iCloud puts every one
  of them there); a reader that finds nothing says ok: False, not ok: True
  next to an empty list
* a backup taken mid-write is a consistent snapshot, and never overwrites

## Not built yet

* `core/sandbox.py` — needed before code mode. gVisor or a microVM **plus an
  egress allowlist**; kernel isolation with open outbound is worth nothing.
* a real `answer()` on `ServedModel` is wired but unexercised against weights.
  The regression runner exists (`./regress.py`) and is honest that stub prose
  makes its numbers meaningless — they start counting when weights are on.
* connectors are read-only. Sending is a separate connector, deliberately not
  written: it needs a `recipient` on `approval` — the first schema migration —
  and it belongs behind the trust gate like everything else that writes.
* Ask can search Blokk's own state but not the mail and calendar content it
  read. Six tools, none of them full-text.
* `span` has no writer and `skill` is decorative. Both are in the schema
  ahead of the code that will use them.

## If you are picking this up cold

Start it with no model at all — `./setup.sh --stubs && ./run.sh` — and press
"Run the sweep". Every mechanism is real; only the prose is fake. That is the
fastest way to see what the system does before reading how.
